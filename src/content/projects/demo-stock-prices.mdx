title: "Demo Stock Prices"
shortDescription: "A coding challenge."
longDescription: "A very simple coding demo that I made when applying for a job. Lets you check the price of several stocks in a specific timeframe and displays it in an chart while also showing the maximum drawdown and the simple return.  
The focus of this challenge was on calculating those values on the frontend. The timeframe is very limited because the API that is being used is just a free version."
